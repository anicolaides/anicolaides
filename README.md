## Journey Into Tech 🌟
<details>

### Early Beginnings 🌱
My fascination with technology began at age 7 when I discovered Nokia's infrared data transfer capabilities. What started as childlike wonder watching files move invisibly between devices evolved into a deeper curiosity about digital communication.

### Web Development Foundations 💻
By age 11, I had built my first website on Freewebs, teaching myself HTML and CSS through experimentation. This initial taste of creation—seeing my code transform into something visible and functional—sparked a passion that continues today.

### Software Exploration 🛠️
In my early teens, I taught myself PHP and database management, building and maintaining my own forum from scratch. These projects weren't just websites; they were laboratories where I developed critical thinking and problem-solving skills through countless hours of coding, debugging, and optimization.

### Hardware & Communications 📡
At 16, I expanded beyond software by designing and installing a 4.2-meter satellite dish. This project bridged theoretical knowledge with hands-on implementation, teaching me about signal processing while developing project management skills that would prove invaluable later.

### Forging My Path 🎯
Despite coming from a family of medical professionals, I deliberately chose technology as my career path. This decision wasn't rebellion but recognition of where my true passions lay—in building digital solutions and pushing the boundaries of what's possible through code.

### Inspirations 💭
My approach has been shaped by tech visionaries like Steve Jobs (innovation), Steve Wozniak (engineering excellence), and Linus Torvalds (open source philosophy). Their examples taught me that technology isn't just about functionality—it's about impact, elegance, and democratizing access to powerful tools.
